# RADIOLOGY REPORT

**Case ID:** test_001
**Date:** 2025-10-07 11:19:40
**Patient:** 65 year old Male
**Study:** ct_chest

## History
Chest pain and shortness of breath

## Technique
Volume scan of chest was done without IV contrast.

## Observations
**Observations:**

**LUNGS:**
- **Parenchyma:** There are multiple centrilobular nodules present in the bilateral lungs, exhibiting a tree-in-bud pattern. Additionally, centriacinar emphysematous changes are noted in both lungs.

**PLEURA:**
- **Effusion:** A right-sided pleural effusion is observed, accompanied by subsegmental collapse of the adjacent lung parenchyma.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest the presence of infectious or inflammatory processes in the lungs, as indicated by the nodules and tree-in-bud pattern, along with emphysematous changes. The right-sided pleural effusion may require further evaluation for underlying etiology.

## Impression
**Impression:**

The CT chest demonstrates multiple centrilobular nodules in both lungs with a tree-in-bud pattern, suggestive of infectious or inflammatory processes, potentially indicating bronchiolitis or a hypersensitivity reaction. Additionally, there are centriacinar emphysematous changes noted bilaterally, consistent with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which may contribute to the patient's shortness of breath. A right-sided pleural effusion is present, associated with subsegmental atelectasis, which could be a contributing factor to the patient's chest pain and respiratory distress. Clinical correlation is recommended to evaluate for possible infectious etiologies or malignancy, especially given the nodular findings. Further management may include thoracentesis for the pleural effusion and consideration of bronchoscopy for the nodules if clinically indicated.
